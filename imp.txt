https://codeforces.com/contest/279/problem/C (Ladder) ://try again urself very good one 
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/332/B (Maximum Absurdity) :/very nice dp problem
https://codeforces.com/contest/505/problem/C (Mr. Kitayuta, the Treasure Hunter) A optimise dp problem ..try to understand the jumps length properly
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/508/C (C. Anya and Ghosts) nice greedy problem
https://codeforces.com/contest/1016/problem/D Easy but thinking matters here

*lipshitz sequence 
------------------
Let  for i ≠ j.

Key observation: it's sufficient to consider j = i + 1 when calculating the Lipschitz constant. It can be seen if you draw points (i, Ai) and lines between them on paper — the steepest lines must be between adjacent pairs of points.

In order to prove it properly, we'll consider three numbers Ai, Aj, Ak (i < j < k) and show that one of the numbers L1(i, j), L1(j, k) is  ≥ L1(i, k). W.l.o.g., we may assume Ai ≤ Ak. There are 3 cases depending on the position of Aj relative to Ai, Ak
